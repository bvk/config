** Messenger should use multiple listener addresses
   This avoids unnecessary delays due to Address-Already-In-Use errors.

   It should attempt to listen on one address at max so that another
   address is left unused and can be listened at after any crash.

   Client messengers should attempt to connect to one of the listener
   addresses, and proceed to the another if connect was not
   successful.
